When creating or editing Page content, you will have the opportunity to work with Paragraphs. Paragraphs are kind of like legos, each one has a unique use case and you put them together to assemble the content you need for your page.

##Adding New Paragraphs
Paragraphs can be used when creating Page content, in the Primary Content section. By default you start with one Paragraph called General Content, which is a basic editor where you can type formatted text. However you can add many more different Paragraph types which can be used in conjunction with your normal page content. 

Underneath the editor, you will see a button that says "Add General Content" with an arrow next to it. By clicking the arrow you can get a list of different Paragraphs you can add.

We will get into the details of what all these different types are, but for now lets add a Callout Box. Callout boxes provide a specially formatted block of text which stands out from the rest of your content. You add one by clicking "Add Callout Box". Once you do this, you will see a new set of fields appear underneath the General Content section. Every Paragraph type has a different set of fields that are used to control that block of content. In this case, we have some text that we want to alert site users about.

If you save this page, you'll see that the information in the Callout Box is formatted differently than the information in General Content.

Now lets say you have more content to add after your Callout Box. Just go back to the Paragraph selector you used to add your Callout Box and you can add another Paragraph for more content. In this case lets just add some more General Content to follow the Callout Box.

If you save again, you'll see that this new General Content appears underneath the previous General Content and the Callout Box.

As you build your pages, you can just continue adding Paragraphs as your page needs. In some case you may not need anything more than General Content, and that is just fine! However for situations where you have more complex use cases, using Paragraphs can give you the ability to provide different kinds of content in a consistent, mobile-friendly, and reusable way.

##Arranging Paragraphs

Once you have created several Paragraphs, you can rearrange them as needed if you want to. Pargraphs display in the same order you see them on your editorial screen, and you can drag or drop them up and down using the "handle" at the top left corner of your Paragraph (it looks like a cross with arrows.) Once you have dragged your Paragraph into position, save your content and you'll see it in your new order.

##Removing Paragraphs

At the top right of every Paragraph is a button labeled "Remove". Click that to remove a Paragraph, and then click "Confirm Removal" to delete it for good. If you change your mind, click the arrow next to "Confirm Removal" and choose "Restore" instead and your content will be restored.

An **Article Listing** is used to create an automated listing of recent content, with different display styles and options.

### Call to Action
A **Call To Action** (or CTA for short) is a link which directs the user to take an action of some sort. An example would be "Register For Classes" or "Sign Up For Our Mailing List". These are rendered as buttons on the website. CTAs can have an optional description which displays above the main link in smaller type.

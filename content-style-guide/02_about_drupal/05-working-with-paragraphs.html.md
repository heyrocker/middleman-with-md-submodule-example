When creating or editing Page content, you will have the opportunity to work with Paragraphs. Pargraphs are just what they sound like - chunks of content that can be arranged to present information in different ways. 

*There should at some point be some details here about how paragraphs can be arranged, how they work in relation to the main page content, etc.*

##Types of Paragraphs
There are several different types of Paragraphs you can work with, each with their own appearance and options. The section Paragraph Types goes into more detail on each type if you want more information on how they can be created or displayed.

### Article Listing
An **Article Listing** is used to create an automated listing of recent content, with different display styles and options.

![Example of the Article Listing type with the Image Headline Blurb style](article-list--image-headline-blurb.png)

[More information on creating Article Listings](../04_paragraph_types/01-article-listing.html)

### Call to Action
A **Call To Action** (or CTA for short) is a link which directs the user to take an action of some sort. An example would be "Register For Classes" or "Sign Up For Our Mailing List". These are rendered as buttons on the website. CTAs can have an optional description which displays above the main link in smaller type.

### Callout Box
A **Callout Box** is used to make information stand out on the page. Callout Boxes have three types: Alert, Aside, and Interrupt.

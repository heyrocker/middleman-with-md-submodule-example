**Terminology tip:** In Drupal every individual piece of "content," like a page, event, blog post, or directory listing, is called a "node." When you go to My Workbench and see a list of items, those are all nodes! A "page" is just one type of node.

## Logging In

When you go to the [Drupal login page](http://staging.new.evergreen.edu/user), you'll be redirected to a CAS login, unless you're already logged in via my.evergreen.edu or another site.

## Workbench
The Workbench is your entry point to all of the content that you work with on the Evergreen site. If you're logged in, you can return to My Workbench from anywhere on Evergreen's main site by clicking *Workbench > My Workbench*.

My Workbench shows a few things, including:

* **My Most Recent Edits:** Last five pages that you have edited.

* **Create Content:** Create an Article or Basic Page. Some users also are able to create news posts or upload files.

* **My Site Section Content:** Longer list of user's previous page edits and updates

## Creating new content
If you click on My Workbench on the toolbar, you can go to Create Content to add a new page. Alternately, from My Workbench, you should see the following links on the left hand side:

* [Upload File](./03-uploading-images-and-files.html#files)
* [Upload Image](./03-uploading-images-and-files.html#images)
* [Create Page](../03_content_types/01-creating-basic-pages.html)
* [Create Blog Post or News Article](../03_content_types/02-creating-blog-posts-or-news-articles.html)

## Editing existing content
Look through the list for the page you want to edit, then click on the Title. This will take you to the page. If you are unable to find the page or wish to search for a page click *Manage > Content* from the toolbar. This will allow you to search for pages. 

You can also go directly to a page you need to edit and click on the Edit tab above the title.

## Removing content
To remove a page from being seen on the published site, you will change its status from Published to Archived. Click the edit button and go the the bottom on the page.

* Under "Change to", choose Archived.
* Click Save.

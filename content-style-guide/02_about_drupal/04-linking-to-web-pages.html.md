When you need to add a link to something that's also part of the Evergreen website, it's critical that you use the button in the editor toolbar (shown below) and then search for the page you want. Here's how that works.

Links have two parts - the text of the link (which users click) and the URL (where users are taken after clicking.) First, type  the text you want to link. Then highlight the text you want to link and click the link button in the toolbar.

For the final step, if it's an Evergreen site, be sure to **search** instead of pasting a link manually. This is important, because it means the link will be formatted properly.

Notice that different categories of content come up when you use that handy-dandy search. This can keep you from having to look things up ahead of time! Just be sure you're linking to what you expected.ðŸ˜„

For links to non-Everegreen sites (like if you need to link to the [Animal Crossing page](https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/) for instance), go ahead and paste the link as you might expect. 

### Create links with your readers -- and accessibility -- in mind

One bad habit leftover from the early days of the web is to do something like this:

[There are many reasons to avoid this](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/links-should-never-say-click-here/), but the main one is that it conceals what users are clicking. This hurts folks who use screen readers, and it also doesn't help search engines understand our links.

So please: think about your links -- it helps everyone!

When you need to add a link in your content, it's critical that you use the button in the editor toolbar and then search for the page you want.

Links have two parts - the text of the link (which users click) and the URL (where users are taken after clicking.) First, type  the text you want to link. Then highlight the text you want to link and click the link button in the toolbar. What you do next depends on whether you are linking to page inside Evergreen's website, or a page outside of Evergreen's website.

### Links Inside Evergreen

If you are linking to a page within the Evergreen website, you can search for the page you're linking to. This is important, because it means the link will be formatted properly and will ensure the link continues to work due to other website changes that might occur. Just start typing into the box, and matching pages will appear in the list below.

Notice that different categories of content come up when you search. This can keep you to find the appropriate thing you're looking for! Just be sure you're linking to what you expected.

### Links Outside Evergreen

For links to non-Everegreen sites (like if you need to link to the [Animal Crossing page](https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/) for instance), copy the URL you want to link to and simply paste it into the field instead of searching.

### Create links with your readers -- and accessibility -- in mind

One bad habit leftover from the early days of the web is to do something like this:

[There are many reasons to avoid this](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/links-should-never-say-click-here/), but the main one is that it conceals what users are clicking. This hurts folks who use screen readers, and it also doesn't help search engines understand our links.

So please: think about your links -- it helps everyone!

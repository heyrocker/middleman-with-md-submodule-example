General Content is the most commonly used paragraph type. It gives users a general purpose editor they can use to write long pieces of formatted text. By default, when creating a new piece of content, you get a General Content paragraph to work with, and most site content will be created using a General Content component.

*TO DO: Will want to add more here about embedding things within the WYSIWYG if we end up going that route.*

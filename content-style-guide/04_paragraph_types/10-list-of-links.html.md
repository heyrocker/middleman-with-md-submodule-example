A list of links allows you to provide a consistently formatted way to display a set of links that live under a common heading. You can use these to provide related links for a piece of content, or for links that all relate to a common topic like registration or visiting Evergreen. The List of Links has the following fields available to control how it displays.

**Header:** This is the topic that your list of links lives under

**Links:** For each link you will provide a URL and a piece of text the user will click on. If you are linking to another page on the Evergreen website, make sure and search for that page rather than simply copying and pasting the URL. For more information on this see [Linking To Web Pages](/02_about_drupal/04-linking-to-web-pages.html).

Gallery allows you to create a photo carousel which will display one photo at a time and allow users to scroll through them. If you select the Gallery paragraph type, you will have the ability to upload an image in addition to its Title and Alt Text. For more information and guidelines on uploading images, see [Uploading Images And Files](../02_about_drupal/03-uploading-images-and-files.html).

Once you have added a file to your gallery, you will have the opportunity to add another one. Continue until all your photos have been uploaded.

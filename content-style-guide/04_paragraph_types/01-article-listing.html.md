Article Listings will create an automated list of recent content posted to the website. The type and format of the content displayed is highly configurable, and the options available to users are too extensive to document in detail here. If you need more help with the Article Listing content beyond this page, please contact web services.

The following options are available for an Article Listing

**Header:** This is the headline for your article list, generally something like Recent Content or New Articles.

**Articles View:** This is the "view" of content that will be displayed in your article listing. There are a wide variety of views to choose from, but the default view, News and Blogs, should be appropriate for most use cases. This will show the 6 most recent pieces of News or Blog Post content. 

**Display ID:** This field controls how your listing will display. These options will change depending on what you choose for Article View above, however the default options for the News and Blogs view are detailed below.

There are also two fields under the Options section that are for advanced use cases and beyond the scope of this tutorial. If you need help with these items, please contact Web Services.

##News and Blogs Display IDs

### Image + Headline
This displays only the Image and Title for each post.

### Image Headline Blurb
This is the same as Image + Headline, but also includes the first 600 characters from each post.

### Image Headline Date
Similarly this is the same however instead of a preview of the content, it just shows the date the content was created.

### Headline Only
This option displays a simple list of headlines and no other information.

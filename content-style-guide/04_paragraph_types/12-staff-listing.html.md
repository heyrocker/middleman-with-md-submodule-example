Staff Listings will create an automated list of college staff. The type and format of the content displayed is highly configurable, and all the options available to users are too extensive to document in detail here. If you need more help with the Staff Listing content beyond this page, please contact web services.

The following options are available for an Article Listing

**Header:** This is the headline for your staff list.

**People Listing:** This is the "view" of staff that will be displayed in your staff listing. There are a wide variety of views to choose from, but the default view, Directories, should be appropriate for most use cases. This will show the 6 most recent pieces of News or Blog Post content. 

**Display ID:** This field controls how your listing will display. These options will change depending on what you choose for People Listing above, however the default options for the Directories view are detailed below.

Unlike other Paragraph types, you will need to use one of the fields underneath Options to get a Staff Listing to work.

**Arguments:** This is where you will create the list of staff you wish to list. For every person you want on your list, you will have to enter their CAS ID followed by a comma. You should not put any spaces between the IDs, or every ID after the first one will be ignored. 

**Include View Title:** This field an be safely ignored.

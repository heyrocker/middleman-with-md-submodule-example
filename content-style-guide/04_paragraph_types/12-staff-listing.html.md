Staff Listings will create an automated list of college staff. The type and format of the content displayed is highly configurable, and all the options available to users are too extensive to document in detail here. If you need more help with the Staff Listing content beyond this page, please contact web services.

The following options are available for an Article Listing

**Header:** This is the headline for your staff list.

**People Listing:** This is the "view" of staff that will be displayed in your staff listing. There are a wide variety of views to choose from, but the default view, Directories, should be appropriate for most use cases. This will show the 6 most recent pieces of News or Blog Post content. 

**Display ID:** This field controls how your listing will display. These options will change depending on what you choose for People Listing above, however the default options for the Directories view are detailed below.

There are also two fields under the Options section that are for advanced use cases and beyond the scope of this tutorial. If you need help with these items, please contact Web Services.

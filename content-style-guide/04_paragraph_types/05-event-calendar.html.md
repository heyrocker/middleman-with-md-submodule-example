Event Calendars will create an automated list of recent events posted to the website. The type and format of the content displayed is highly configurable, and the options available to users are too extensive to document in detail here. If you need more help with the Event Calendar content beyond this page, please contact web services.

*TO DO: Add screenshot from admin*

The following options are available for an Event Calendar

**Header:** This is the headline for your article list, generally something like Upcoming Events.

**Calendar View:** This is the "view" of content that will be displayed in your article listing. There are a wide variety of views to choose from, but the default view, Events Calendars, should be appropriate for most use cases. 

**Display ID:** This field controls how your listing will display. These options will change depending on what you choose for Calendar View above, however the default options for the Event Calendars view are detailed below.

There are also two fields under the Options section that are for advanced use cases and beyond the scope of this tutorial. If you need help with these items, please contact Web Services.

##Calendar View Display IDs

### Holidays
*TO DO: I couldn't get this to work*

### Site Section Headlines
This Display ID displays the title, date, and location of each event. It only the upcoming events that are associated with the same site section as the piece of content they are attached to. So if you add this paragraph to a News Article that is in Admissions, it will *only* show events for Admissions.

### Site Section Details
This behaves exactly the same as Site Section Headlines, but it also displays the full text description of the events.

### Site Section Slider
This section behaves exactly the same as Site Section Headlines however it displays with calendar icons representing the date, and only the title of each event. Site Section Slider only displays 5 events, but it also has a link to view a full calendar. This is the most commonly used Display ID.

### Day As Block
Day As Block displays all of the events scheduled for today in a standard daily calendar type of interface. This will display all events for a day and does not filter by site section as the earlier display types did.

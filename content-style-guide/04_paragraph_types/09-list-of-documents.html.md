Functionally, the Document List is very similar to the [Gallery](../04_paragraph_types/07-gallery.html). Users can create a listing of a number of arbitrary documents which they choose. This is particularly useful when a piece of content may refer to a number of related files or documents.

When you add a Document List, you will have the ability to choose which documents you want to list. Note that these documents must have already been added to the system by following the instructions at [Uploading Images And Files](../02_about_drupal/03-uploading-images-and-files.html). If your files are already uploaded, you can search for them in the field under Use Existing Media. If you need more documents, just click the Add Another Item button until you are done adding documents.

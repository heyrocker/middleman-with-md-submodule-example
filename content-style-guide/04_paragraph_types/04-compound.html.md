Compound paragraph types are simply an image and a chunk of text aligned to the left of the image. This is a very simple way to a align an image and text into two columns. There are two fields available in the Compound type.

**Image:** This allows you to either upload an image or choose from an existing image that had been uploaded previously. You will also need to add a name for this image so that other people can find it, as well as the image's Alt Text. For more information see [Uploading Images and Files](../02_about_drupal/03-uploading-images-and-files.htmls).

**Text:** This is the text that will be placed alongside the image.

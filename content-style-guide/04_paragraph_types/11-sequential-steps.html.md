Sequential Steps, as its name implies, allows you to create a set of sequential numbered steps that guide a user through a process. The steps will be automatically numbered in the order they exist in the system.

When entering Sequential Steps, you will be shown a text field similar to the one you use when you enter General Content. You will fill out one of these for each step in your process. Once your current step has been entered, click Add Another Item to add your next step. Continue this process until all your steps have been entered.

If you have entered steps in the wrong order, you can drag or drop them to using the icon that looks like four arrows at the top left of your step.

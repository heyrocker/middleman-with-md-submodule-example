Forms allow you to place different kinds of forms or surveys on your pages. If you need to accept form submissions from website users, you need to contact the web team and they will create one for you. Once that is done you will have the ability to place it onto a page using the Form component.

*TO DO: Add screenshot from admin*

The following options are available for a Form

**Form:** Once your form is complete, web team will tell you what the form's name is. That name should appear in this list, where you can select it to get the form displayed in your page.

**Form Settings:** By opening the Form Settings area, you will be able to setup whether or not your form is open to take submissions. There are three options

- **Open:** This means your form is available and users will be able to respond to it.
- **Closed:** This means your form is closed and users will not be able to respond to it.
- **Scheduled:** This allows you to schedule a date and time that your form will open and/or close. If you select the Scheduled option, then your form must have an Open time set. The Closed time is optional, and if not set your form will remain open until it is manually closed.

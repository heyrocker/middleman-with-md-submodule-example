**Box Type:** This controls how the Callout Box is displayed on the page. The three options are Alert, Aside, and Interupt. The differences between these are described below.

**Content:** This is where you enter the content for the Callout Box. This includes any headlines, text, or images you want to be part of your callout. All of the same formatting options are available here as in other text fields throughout the site.

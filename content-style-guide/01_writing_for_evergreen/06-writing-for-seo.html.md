Many of the topics described in [Writing For Accessibility](./05-writing-for-accessibility.html) also apply to writing for SEO. Nesting topics with headings allows search engines to understand your content and how it is organized. Clear links and simple language allow your content to be found more easily. Overall, the best thing you can do for SEO is to write clear and concise content, related to a specific topic, which provides information that your site visitors will find useful.

That said, there are a couple important things you can do to make sure that your content is found properly, and then when it is found it is presented in a way that will inspire users to click on it.

## Use shorter titles
If a title is too long, it will get truncated when your content is shared to social media or displayed in search engine results. This can result in confusion for users, or in worst cases, presenting a title whose meaning is changed from what you had intended. Titles should be around 65 characters or less in order to avoid truncation. 

## Provide a description
When articles appear in search results, they also include a short description. In many cases this description is simply the first content on the page truncated to fit. This can create problems for users as described above. Instead, write descriptions specifically for the purpose of display in these use cases. This description should be under 200 characers, and should provide an overview of the main topics covered in the page.

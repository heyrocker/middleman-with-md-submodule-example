Just like a [Basic Page](01-creating-basic-pages.html), every Blog Post or News Article has fields that hold the different pieces of information that make up a page. The exact fields vary to match the content type.

## What you can edit
For Blog Posts or News Articles, these are the fields you can edit:

•	**Site Section**: this determines what site title, navigation, and background image appears on the page. You can only assign pages to a site section that you have permission to edit.

•	**Title**: in addition to appearing at the top of the page and in the browser title bar, this field is used to generate the page's URL (web address). Contact the Web Team if you need an alternate URL (like a shorter one for print).

•	**Byline**: This indicates who this article will get credited to. By default this is set to Evergreen Staff, but this can be changed or removed if desired.

•	**Body**: Unlike Basic Page content, you cannot use Paragraphs with Blog Posts or News Articles. Instead, enter the content in the Body field, where you can format it and add images and links as normal.

•	**Tags**: Tags are used to identify topics for your article, and to aggregate similar topics throughout the site. You can use any of the already existing tags or add tags of your own. To use an existing tag, just start typing into the field, and choices will appear which match what you type. You can select one of these to use as a tag. If you need to add a new tag, just type it into the field and when the article is saved, it will be added as a new tag.

•	**Image**: This image will appear at the top of your article between the headling and your article's text. Unlike some other areas of the site, you must upload a new image here rather than using an existing one. ***TO DO: Verify this is in fact true.w***

### Other parts of the page

The **logo, search, top navigation, and footer** are all set for the site as a whole . These cannot be adjusted for individual pages or site sections.

The site section navigation is set per section (/advising, /housing, etc). The navigation is broken into chunks with no more than 8 links per chunk. Navigation items are generally arranged alphabetically. Only the Web Team can edit your site section navigation. If you need this edited, please [put in a ticket](www.evergreen.edu/web) to request changes.

Contact information is created from the Campus Directory. If you want changes made to that information, please [put in a ticket](help.evergreen.edu) and ask for a directory change in adminweb.

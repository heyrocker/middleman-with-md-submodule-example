Every page has fields that hold the different pieces of information or "fields" that make up a page. The exact fields vary to match the content type.

## What you can edit
For Basic Pages, these are the fields you can edit:

•	**Site Section**: this determines what site title, navigation, and background image appears on the page. You can only assign pages to a site section that you have permission to edit.

•	**Title**: in addition to appearing at the top of the page and in the browser title bar, this field is used to generate the page's URL (web address). Contact the Web Team if you need an alternate URL (like a shorter one for print).

•	**Introduction**: The Introduction field should contain the very short paragraph that appears in green at the top of the page. No formatting or links are permitted in this field. It should simply be a statement that helps a visitor understand where they've landed and what they can do on this page.

•	**Primary Content**: The Primary Content field should contain the majority of the page's useful information. This is also where you can add, arrange, and remove [Paragraphs](../02_about_drupal/05-working-with-paragraphs.html). 

•	**Secondary Content**: Anything in the Secondary Content field appears at the bottom of the page in up to three boxes under the Primary Content.

### Other parts of the page

The **logo, search, top navigation, and footer** are all set for the site as a whole . These cannot be adjusted for individual pages or site sections.

The site section navigation is set per section (/advising, /housing, etc). The navigation is broken into chunks with no more than 8 links per chunk. Navigation items are generally arranged alphabetically. Only the Web Team can edit your site section navigation. If you need this edited, please [put in a ticket](www.evergreen.edu/web) to request changes.

Contact information is created from the Campus Directory. If you want changes made to that information, please [put in a ticket](help.evergreen.edu) and ask for a directory change in adminweb.

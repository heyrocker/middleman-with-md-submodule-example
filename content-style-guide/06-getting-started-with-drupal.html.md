## Logging In

When you go to the [Drupal login page](http://staging.new.evergreen.edu/user), you'll be redirected to a CAS login, unless you're already logged in via my.evergreen.edu or another site.

## Workbench
The Workbench is your entry point to all of the content that you work with on the Evergreen site. If you're logged in, you can return to My Workbench from anywhere on Evergreen's main site by clicking *Workbench > My Workbench*.

My Workbench shows a few things, including:

* **My Most Recent Edits:** Last five pages that you have edited.
* **Create Content:** Create an Article or Basic Page. Some users also are able to create news posts or upload files.
* **My Site Section Content:** Longer list of user's previous page edits and updates

## Editing Existing Content
**Terminology tip:** In Drupal every individual piece of "content," like a page, event, blog post, or directory listing, is called a "node." When you go to My Workbench and see a list of items, those are all nodes! A "page" is just one type of node.

#### From My Workbench, My Edits or All Recent Content
Look through the list for the page you want to edit, then click on the Title. This will take you to the page. If you are unable to find the page or wish to search for a page click *Manage > Content* from the toolbar. This will allow you to search for pages. 

#### From the page itself
You can also go directly to a page you need to edit and click on the Edit tab above the title.

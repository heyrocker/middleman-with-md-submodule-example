Every piece of content we publish contains a collection of small chunks, each one with a specific purpose that impacts presentation, SEO, accessibility, and a host of other purposes. This section lays the uses cases for these web elements. You can also see [Writing For Accessibility](/12-writing-for-accessibility.html.md) and [Writing For SEO](/13-writing-for-seo.html.md)

## Guidelines

### Alt text

Alt text is a way to label images, and it's especially important for people who can’t see the images on our website. Alt text should describe the image in a brief sentence or two.

For more on how and why we use alt text, read the [Accessibility](/12-writing-for-accessibility.html.md) section.

### Headings and subheadings

Headings and subheadings organize content for readers, and are an important element that allow search engines to find and index your content. Be generous and descriptive.

Headings (H1) give people a taste of what they’re about to read. Use them for page and blog titles.

Subheadings (H2, H3, etc.) break articles into smaller, more specific sections. They give readers avenues into your content and make it more scannable.

Headings and subheadings should be organized in a hierarchy, with heading first, followed by subheadings in order. (An H2 will nestle under H1, an H3 under H2, and on down.)

Include the most relevant keywords in your headings and subheadings, and make sure you cover the main point of the content.

Use title case, unless the heading is a punctuated sentence. If the heading is a punctuated sentence, use sentence case. Use sentence case for subheadings regardless of end punctuation.

Always use heading styles from the drop down in your editor for these use cases. Doing things like simply bolding text on its own line will not bring the same benefits, and causes problems for assistive devices.

### Links

Provide a link whenever you’re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.

Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:

- Yes: Read the [automation guide](#) for details.
- No: Read [the automation guide](#) for details.

If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark.

Don’t say things like “Click here!” or “Click for more information” or “Read this.” Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.

### Lists

Use lists to present steps, groups, or sets of information. Give context for the list with a brief introduction. Number lists when the order is important, like when you’re describing steps of a process. Don’t use numbers when the list’s order doesn’t matter. Use bullets instead.  

If one of the list items is a complete sentence, use proper punctuation and capitalization on all of the items. If list items are not complete sentences, don’t use punctuation, but do capitalize the first word of each item.

### Titles

Titles organize pages and guide readers. A title appears at the beginning of a page or section and briefly describes the content that follows.

Don’t use punctuation in a title unless the title is a question.

Titles should be no more than 60 characters if possible, otherwise they will get truncated when the page is shown in search results.

## SEO

We write for humans, not machines. We don't use gross SEO techniques like keyword stuffing to bump search results. But we also want to make it easy for people and search engines to find and share our content. Here are some not-icky ways to do this:

* Organize your page around one topic. Use clear, descriptive terms in titles and headings that relate to the topic at hand.

* Use descriptive headings to structure your page and highlight important information.

* Give every image descriptive alt text.

When creating or editing Page content, you will have the opportunity to work with Paragraphs. Pargraphs are just what they sound like - chunks of content that can be arranged to present information in different ways. 

*There should at some point be some details here about how paragraphs can be arranged, how they work in relation to the main page content, etc.*

There are several different types of Paragraphs you can work with, each with their own appearance and options.
